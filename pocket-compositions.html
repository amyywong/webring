<p>I kinda like it when you hurt me</p>
<p>I start believing all your stories</p>
<p>But I'd rather hear you lie than to hear you say goodbye to me</p>
<p>So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed</p>
<p>If you're gonna lie, at least do it in my bed</p>
<p>So if you're gonna lie, do it in my bed</p>
<p>If you're gonna lie, make it worth it</p>

<p>Wish I could get a little un-drunk so I could un-call you</p>
<p>At 5 in the morning, I would un-fuck you</p>
<p>But some things you can't undo</p>
<p>I wish I could un-kiss the room full of strangers</p>
<p>So I could un-spite you, un-lose my temper</p>
<p>But some things you can't undo</p>
<p>And one of them's you</p>

  <div class="song-name" id="alllove">all love</div>
  <div class="lyrics" id="love-lyrics">
<p>We started out as friends in the Lower East</p>
<p>Did a couple drugs at the house parties</p>
<p>Late nights in taxi cabs</p>
<p>Wish I could have 'em back</p>
<p>'Cause there's a lot of things that I never said</p>
<p>Now you're with somebody else in a different bed</p>
<p>You're happy, I could see</p>
<p>And that's so hard for me</p>

<p>When you walk in the bar with someone holding hands</p>
<p>Introduce me to her, say I'm just an old friend</p>
<p>And you ask how I've been</p>
<p>I say I'm doing fine but I'm fucking lying</p>

<p>I take another shot, need the novocaine</p>
<p>Wish it would numb my heart way it numbs my brain</p>
<p>But it's all love</p>
<p>I don't feel it, but it's all love</p>
<p>The way you kiss her on her neck with that look in your eyes</p>
<p>Do it right in front of me kinda makes me wanna die</p>
<p>But it's all love</p>
<p>I hate the feeling, but it's all love</p>

  <div class="song-name" id="about">about you</div>
  <div class="lyrics" id="about-lyrics">
<p>I'm not tired, I'm not lonely</p>
<p>So why does my mind go back to when you used to hold me?</p>
<p>Time, yeah, it's been enough time</p>
<p>To get you out of my mind</p>

<p>But now I'm thinking, I'll never stop thinking about you</p>
<p>Yeah, I'm just wondering when I'll stop wondering about you</p>
<p>You got your hands on me, you got your hands on me</p>
<p>A thousand miles away, but you still got your hands on me</p>
<p>And I'm thinking, I'll never stop thinking about you</p>

<p>Going new places, meeting new faces</p>
<p>But your memory still isn't fading</p>
<p>Ya, ya, ya ya, ya, ya, ya ya</p>
<p>Maybe I still got some shit left to say</p>
<p>Maybe your ghost is stuck in my brain</p>
<p>Ya, ya, ya ya, ya, ya</p>

  <div class="lyrics" id="strangers-lyrics">
<p>No time's the right time to reach out but here I go</p>
<p>Always scared to love, wouldn't be enough, never be enough, we were way too young</p>
<p>The way we ended it, you know it makes me sick</p>
<p>How two people once could be so in love, now we never talk, never talk about</p>

<p>All the things we said and couldn't take back</p>
<p>Swear I never meant it, and I hate that I hurt you</p>
<p>What I know right now, I wish I knew then</p>
<p>I'm trying to but I still don't understand</p>

<p>We started out as strangers, now we're strangers again</p>
<p>The things I love about you, I'm supposed to forget</p>
<p>And every time I think about you, it don't make any sense</p>
<p>We started out as strangers, now we're strangers again</p>

<p>Dive bars and our first kiss</p>
<p>Sophomores without scars yet</p>
<p>36 months, just the two of us, only one mistake to mess it up</p>
<p>I know I took so long to give you a response</p>
<p>It was just my pride pushing it aside, pushing you aside, make you wait for once</p>

<p>All the things we said and couldn't take back (Couldn't take back)</p>
<p>Swear I never meant it, and I hate that I hurt you (Hate that I hurt you)</p>
<p>What I know right now, I wish I knew then</p>
<p>I'm trying to but I still don't understand</p>

<p>We started out as strangers, now we're strangers again (Strangers again)</p>
<p>The things I love about you, I'm supposed to forget (Supposed to forget)</p>
<p>And every time I think about you, it don't make any sense (Don't make any sense)</p>
<p>We started out as strangers, now we're strangers again</p>
